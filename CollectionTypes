##------syntax--------
list1 = [3,5,8,2,5,5,1]
tuple1 = (3,5,8,2,5,5,1)
set1 = {3,5,8,2,5,5,1}

##------duplicates--------
##set removes duplicates, but list and tuple won't
list1 = [3,5,8,2,5,5,1]
tuple1 = (3,5,8,2,5,5,1)
set1 = {3,5,8,2,5,5,1}

print(list1)
print(tuple1)
print(set1)

##------order--------
##list and tuple maintain the same order they have but set shuffles the order
list1 = [3,5,8,2,5,5,1]
tuple1 = (3,5,8,2,5,5,1)
set1 = {3,5,8,2,5,5,1}

print(list1)
print(tuple1)
print(set1)

##------Indexing--------
##in list and tuple, we can select element via indexing but not in set because set won't retain the same order
list1 = [3,5,8,2,5,5,1]
tuple1 = (3,5,8,2,5,5,1)
set1 = {3,5,8,2,5,5,1}

print(list1[1])
print(tuple1[0])
print(set1[2])

##------Mutable--------
##Mutable means changeable. list and set are changable/modifyable, but not the tuple, hence tuple is unmutable and list and set are mutable
list1 = [3,5,8,2,5,5,1]
tuple1 = (3,5,8,2,5,5,1)
set1 = {3,5,8,2,5,5,1}

list1[2] = 9
list1.append(10)
list1.remove(1)

tuple1[2] = 9
tuple1.append(10)
tuple1.remove(1)
#Tuples are unmutable, hence any of above operation will not work

set1.add(10)
set1.remove(1)
set1[1] = 12 ##this will give error as it won't support indexing

print(list1)
print(tuple1)
print(set1)
